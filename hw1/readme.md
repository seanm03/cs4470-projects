Note: Since my checkboxes were inverted, I used code from alt_checkbox.py and images provided by
the class resources GitHub page.

Additionally, I found a small quirk with the phone number text field, where if a phone number was
successfully formatted & entered, a user could not edit the number unless they cleared the field.
I could not figure out how to fix it and I assumed the current version is acceptable enough for this
first homework, so I left that quirk unfixed.
