# Issues:
- The victory audio overlaps with whatever sound is playing when the pieces move.
- Sometimes adjacent pieces are unable to be clicked and the game is unable to progress.
- Pieces can not be moved after loading up a new game within the same active session.
- Capture logic may be too loose, allowing too many pieces to be captured in a single turn.
- Resizing the window yields weird graphical bugs involving "phantom pieces".
- Pieces do not change color when selected.
